# Diabetes Patient Analysis (Phase1)
### Project Overview 
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Phase 1 of this project involves the analysis of the data to show the distribution of diabetic patients and determine the relationship between the featured data and the outcome.

### Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Diabetes.csv", which was provided by MeriSkill for my Intership program.
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
### Tools Used
- Excel (For Data Cleaning)
- PowerBI (EDA and Visualization Report)
### Data Cleaning/Preparation
Activities carried out to make sure the data is fit for analyses;
- Load and inspeact the data to check for integrity and identify impurities
- Handling missing and outlier values
- Reformatting - Correcting data format and accurate data types
###  Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA and exploring the data to answer the main question such as;
- What is the correlation between various feature in the dataset?
- Does patient weight affect the outcome?
- What is the relationship between Blood pressure and Glucose level with the outcome?
- Is Age a factor for Diabetes?
### Data Analysis Result
The analysis results are summarized as follows;
- 22% of young adult sampled (age 20-29) tested positive while a larger proportion by class of diabetic patient are from the Adult (age 30-39) and Middle Age Adult (age 40-59). Very few percentage of Senior Citizen tested positive.
- 46% of Obese patients have diabetes followed by 22% of overweight patient. Normal weight and underweight patient have little or no diabetes affinity.
  This shows that Body Mass Index (BMI) is a factor to consider when looking out for patient with diabetic affinity.
- 60% of patients with high glucose level are suffering from diabetes which is not a surprise as high sugar level is associated with diabetes.
- 50% of patients suffering from Hypertension stage 1 and 2 tested positive for diabetes.
- Surprisingly patients with normal blood pressure also tested positive for diabetes which is due to their overweight and high sugar level.
